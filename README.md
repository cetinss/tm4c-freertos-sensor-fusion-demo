# tm4c-freertos-sensor-fusion-demo
A simple train control system demo for ARM Cortex-M4, showcasing advanced FreeRTOS concepts: inter-task synchronization (Task Notifications) and thread-safe resource management (Mutex).

# üöÜ TM4C-FreeRTOS Train Control System

This repository contains the source code for a **real-time embedded system** developed on the **Tiva C TM4C1294XL** platform.  

What began as a simple *train control* concept evolved into a **practical case study** on solving fundamental challenges in multi-threaded embedded environments using **FreeRTOS**.  

The **primary goal** of this project is not just to read from sensors, but to demonstrate a **robust and professional software architecture** that correctly handles resource sharing, task synchronization, and hardware faults.

## üìñ Project Overview  

The system utilizes two independent sensors:  
- **Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)** ‚Üí Detects ambient light (simulates tunnels).  
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** ‚Üí Measures distance to detect obstacles.  

Each sensor is managed by its own **dedicated FreeRTOS task**.  
Tasks run **concurrently**, providing:  
- Visual feedback via LEDs,  
- Real-time console output via UART,  
- Predictable and fault-tolerant execution flow.  

The **true complexity** and **educational value** of this project lie in the **architectural decisions** made to ensure the system is **stable, deterministic, and reliable**.

## üß© Architectural Deep Dive & Concepts Demonstrated  

This project is a practical guide to **common RTOS challenges** and their solutions.  

### 1. Resource Management ‚Üí Mutex to Solve Race Conditions  
- **Problem**: Both tasks attempted to write to the UART simultaneously ‚Üí garbled, interleaved, unreadable output.  
- **Solution**: A **FreeRTOS Mutex** was introduced.  
  - Tasks must *lock* the mutex before writing.  
  - If UART is busy, tasks block without wasting CPU cycles.  
- **Outcome**: All UART messages are now atomic and **thread-safe**.  

---

### 2. Task Synchronization ‚Üí Deterministic Execution with Notifications  
- **Problem**: Even with mutex protection, task order was random (e.g., LDR twice before Distance).  
- **Solution**: **Task Notifications** used as lightweight binary signals.  
  - Tasks follow a **ping-pong** scheme:  
    - `TaskLDR` notifies ‚Üí `TaskDistance`  
    - `TaskDistance` notifies ‚Üí `TaskLDR`  
- **Outcome**: Tasks execute in a strict alternating order:
  LDR ‚Üí Distance ‚Üí LDR ‚Üí Distance ‚Üí ...
Predictable and perfectly synchronized.  

---

### 3. System Robustness ‚Üí Defensive Programming in Drivers  
- **Problem**: A faulty sensor (e.g., loose wire on HC-SR04) caused infinite loops, freezing the system.  
- **Solution**: Drivers were rewritten with **timeouts**.  
- ADC read (LDR) returns `0xFFFFFFFF` on timeout.  
- Distance read (HC-SR04) returns negative values (`-1`, `-2`) on timeout.  
- **Outcome**:  
- Errors are reported in console instead of freezing.  
- The system **remains alive** and continues notifying other tasks.  
- Faults can be recovered automatically when hardware returns to normal.
